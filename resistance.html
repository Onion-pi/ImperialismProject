					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was quite a bit of resistance to colonization in Morocco. Initially, when the Arab government took over in the 700s or so, there was a large rebellion to the change in leadership. In addition, invasions by Portugal and Spain between the 1500s and 1600s helped unify Morocco, and helped create a Moroccan army. </p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This army, composed of troops called Corsairs and Sharifs, was highly effective and helped Morocco maintain independence for many years. Morocco was a very important trading power, which is another way it resisted colonization for a very long time. The economic situation was very good there, which is partially because of all the refugees from Spain.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as the French took over, national parties almost immediately began to lobby for Moroccan independence. There were also a number of peaceful protests. However, partially because, the French let the Moroccan King <em>technically</em> remain on the throne, winning independence in Morocco was easy, compared to many other countries.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Moroccan king maintained much of his original station and dignity, although he lost most of his power when the French took over. This is part of what allowed the period of Moroccan imperialism to be so short-lived.</p>
