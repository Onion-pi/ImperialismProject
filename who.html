					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Morocco has a long history of being invaded and colonized by various foriegn powers, but the time of the industrial revolution, these groups had more or less blended into Moroccan culture. The Berbers were the first to live in Morocco. Then, from 40-600, it was ruled by the Romans, Vandals, and Byzantines. However, the first major conquest came in 680, when Muslim Arabs invaded Morocco and took control. The Bebers resented Arab rule, although they adopted Islam.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 700, Morocco was ruled by a unified Arab and Beber dynasty. This was the makeup of the Moroccan rule for the next few hundred years. In 1050 or so, though, the dynasty switched to a Muslim Beber dynasty, which then kept control for a while. In addition, when Muslims, and Jews, were expelled from Spain, many of them came to Morocco.</p>

					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1912, Moroccan trade had grown increasingly biased towards foriegn powers. Because Morocco is in a highly stragegic location, near the Medeterranian Sea, many European powers grew interested in clonizing it. Cheif among these was France. As the Moroccan King faltered in terms of keeping control of the country, the French stepped in to help "keep order." In 1912, Morocco officially became a Protectorate of France.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that wasn't the only country that colonized Morocco. A section of Northern Morocco was colonized by Spain, at around the same time. That section was the Northwestern corner, as well as a section near the South, called the Ifni enclave.</p>
