					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were many effects of imperialism on Morocco. The initial colonization, by Arabs in 680, led to the adoption of Islam by a significant portion of the population. In addition, Arab is now one of Morocco's main ethnic groups. </p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, these were minor and somewhat beneficial effects, compared to the effects of French and Spanish colonization.</p>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French forced many Moroccans to assimilate to French culture, which led to the loss of many Moroccan traditions. They had to speak French, wear Western clothes, and eat Western food.</p> 
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;France also set up mines and factories, which Moroccans were sometimes forced to work in for little or no pay, which is part of how traditional Moroccan industries were disrupted by colonization. A Morrocan mine is pictured to the left.</p>
