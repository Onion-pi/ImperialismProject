					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The National Independence movement, which lobbied for Moroccan independence beginning in the 1930s, succeeded in winning Moroccan independence in 1956. This also followed a series of negotiations, lasting years, between the French and the Moroccan king. The parts of Morocco ruled by Spain took longer to come under Moroccan control, and there are still inconsistencies between maps over where, exactly, that border falls.</p> 
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morocco is currently a constitutional monarchy, and lingering evidence of French and Spanish rule still remains. Many Moroccans speak French and Spanish, and Arabic is the official language of the country. People combine traditional and Western clothes and food. Most artistic traditions blend French, Spanish, and traditional influences. Schools are taught in French and Arabic. </p>
